Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on building a Churn Prediction Model using the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. The dataset contains information about customers who have either stayed with or left the company, and our task is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Goal:
To perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn or not.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. It includes various demographic and service-related features such as:

CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (1, 0).
Partner: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes/No).
Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No).
PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service (Yes/No).
MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes/No/No phone service).
InternetService: The type of internet service used by the customer (DSL/Fiber optic/No).
Contract: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
Churn: Whether the customer churned or not (Yes/No).
Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
Binary Encoding: Convert binary categorical variables like Gender, Partner, Churn into numerical form using LabelEncoder.

One-Hot Encoding: Convert multi-category variables such as InternetService, Contract, PaymentMethod into numerical form using pd.get_dummies().

Handling Missing Data: If any missing values are present, proper handling is done using techniques such as filling with the median or most frequent value.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploring the relationships between customer churn and various features.
Visualizing data patterns using histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps.
Key insights such as:
How contract type affects churn.
How senior citizens or customers with dependents churn more often.
3. Building a Predictive Model
A Decision Tree Classifier is used to predict whether a customer will churn.
The dataset is split into training and test sets.
Model evaluation is done using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.
Installation
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
How to Run
Download the dataset from the repository or a source like Kaggle (if not included in the project).
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
Visualize the data using EDA techniques to understand patterns.
Train the decision tree model to predict customer churn.
Evaluate the model performance on the test data.
Results
After running the model, we can predict the likelihood of a customer churning.
Detailed visualizations and insights will be provided in the analysis notebook.
Future Improvements
Try other algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, or Gradient Boosting to improve accuracy.
Feature engineering: Create new features like tenure buckets, customer segments, etc.
Hyperparameter tuning: Use GridSearchCV to fine-tune the model parameters for better performance.
